    "6-1. The distribution of income is famously skewed to the right. In this exercise, we'll measure how strong that skew is. The Current populaiton Survey (CPS) is a joint effort of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau to study income and related variables. Data collected in 2013 is available fromt he Census Burea's website. I downlaoded hinc06.xls, which is an Excel spreadsheet with information about household income, and converted it to hinc06.csv, A CSV file you will find in the repository for this book. You will also find hinc2.py, which reads this file and transforms the data. The dataset is in the form of a series of income ranges and the number of respondents who fell in each range. THe lowest range includes respondents who reported annual household income \"Under $5000\". THe highest range includes respondents who made \"$250,000 or more\". The estimate mean and other statistics from these data, we have to maek some assumptions about the lower and upper bounds, and how the values are distributed in reach range. hinc2.py provides InterolateSample, which shoes one way to model this data. It takes a DataFrome with a column, income, that contains the upper bound of each range, and freq, which contains the number of respondents in each frame. It also take log_upper, which is an assumed upper bound on the highest range, expressed in log10dollars. The default value, log_upper = 6.0 represents the assumption that the largest income among the respondents is 10^6, or one million dollars. InterpolateSample generates a pseudo-sample; thata is a sample of household incomes that yields the same number of respondents in each range as the actual data. It assumes that incomes in reach range are equally spaced on a log10 scale. Computer the mean, median, skewness, and Pearson's skewness of the resultsing sample. What fraction of households reports a taxable income below the mean? How do the results depend on the assumed upper bound? "
